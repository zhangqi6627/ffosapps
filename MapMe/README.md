MapMe App
============

Firefox OS App for displaying a user's current location on a map.

This app was written from scratch by Alex Hirschberg with influence from the Leaflet quickstart tutorials.  The icons are pulled from Chapter 5 of Roman Irani's Firefox OS tutorial series.

The tutorial that discusses the app can be found at
