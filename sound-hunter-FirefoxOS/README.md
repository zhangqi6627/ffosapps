# Sound Hunter

It's an app to Firefox OS, which searches for music on multiple sources. The app is a child project of [Sound Hunter Website](http://raphamorim.com/sound-hunter/) that looks for music using speech recognition.

## How it works?

The current version allows the user to search by artist, song name or lyrics.

Currently, it uses only results from Youtube as a proof of concept to Mozilla Hackathon in Campus Party Brazil 7, but other sources will be available soon.
