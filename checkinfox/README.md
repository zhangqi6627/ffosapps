Check-in Fox
============

Easy to use FourSquare client for Firefox OS
--------------------------------------------

As FourSquare expressed that they [don't have a plan yet for releasing their client for Firefox OS](https://twitter.com/4sqSupport/status/306790266734510080),
I decided to implement some of the basic functionality so people can use the service
until a full-fledged official client app is released.

The app focus is on quick and easy checking in to places, as effortlessly as it is
humanly possible. :)


Features
--------

This version of Check-in Fox is still an early beta, it lacks several functions
compared to the official client on other platforms, but more features will be added
and expanded on in the future.

 - Authentication with the foursquare API
 - Geolocation via geoip/device GPS/AGPS
 - Last check-in display
 - List and search venues around current location
 - Display venue details and photos
 - Check-in, attach a photo, send a shout
 - Share check-in to Facebook and/or Twitter
 - Firefox OS-native UI
 - Extensive help and setup instructions


Using and installing
--------------------

You could use Check-in Fox online, from your Firefox OS phone or android phone via
Firefox for Android by opening [https://checkinfox-flaki.rhcloud.com](https://checkinfox-flaki.rhcloud.com).

On Firefox OS you may choose to install the app on your phone - you can accomplish this
from the menu of the hosted application (on the link above), or from the Firefox Marketplace
(as soon as it is approved).


Known issues
------------

Geolocation is GPS-based on Firefox OS devices, so it will only work outdoors. This is
a platform limitation which hopefully will soon be addressed. Until then, make sure you
read the help, and set up your device correctly.
