# WordPress for Firefox OS

WordPress for Firefox OS was started in the Summer of 2013 by [Sayak Sarkar](https://github.com/sayak-sarkar) as a Google Summer of Code project.  The app is based on WordPress for webOS, but adapted for smaller screens and styled to be more consistent with WordPress for Android.

## Getting started:

To get started you will need a copy of the Firefox OS Simulator, a clone of this repository, and your favorite text editor - Firefox OS apps are built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

To test the app, launch the Firefox OS Simulator from the Firefox Tools > Web Developer > Firefox OS Simulator menu and add the project directory to the Simulator.
