FeedMonkey
==========

RSS client for Firefox OS

Get it on the [Mozilla Marketplace](https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/feedmonkey/)

A RSS mobile client with which you can read your RSS feeds and mark them as read on your server. 

- You swipe right and left to navigate through the articles.
- Works also offline.
- You can chose between 4 fresh color schemes.

To use this RSS client to read your feeds you need a backend server. As a backend you can use [TinyTinyRSS](http://tt-rss.org), [ownCloud News](http://apps.owncloud.com/content/show.php/News?content=158434) or [Pond](https://github.com/ArturoVM/pond#pond). This is not a stand alone application.
